At Articulate we've been building e-learning software and tools as a [fully remote company for over fifteen years](https://hackernoon.com/why-i-chose-to-build-a-fully-remote-company-before-it-was-cool-6aa750cde1a2). So we've naturally evolved unique approaches to a lot of traditional business processes. Today our Platform Engineering team is made up of thirteen people residing in the United States, Canada, India, and The Netherlands. We use this wide time zone distribution to our advantage by running fully distributed, asynchronous team interviews in Slack.

## Why would you even

Finding people in far off time zones isn't particularly difficult. Throw a work-from-home job ad on the internet and wait for the applications to start rolling in! But how do you reliably vet excellent candidates around the world? A couple of years ago our team began experimenting with Slack-based team interviews. The goals were to give everyone on the team a voice in hiring, preserve the best parts of our culture, and find amazing talent regardless of where they live. Positive human dynamics are crucial for high performing teams so we ideally want everyone's buy-in on things that will change those dynamics. I guarantee your team will do better at surfacing deeper and more relevant signals for a strong addition than one hiring manager on their own.

Because we're a globally distributed, time zone diverse company, we rely heavily on async communication. Many companies are "remote friendly" or "remote first." We're remote always. We're always thinking about how to effectively work together when we aren't in the same physical space.

## Running the Slack interview

We're continuously evolving our processes but here's how we approach the Slack team interview today. Feel free to use this as a starting guide for running a Slack interview for your team.

The hiring manager runs the initial phone interview with the candidate (we'll call them Robin) and gets an understanding of technical depth, breadth, career trajectory, interests, personality, etc. If that goes well we send an email like this:

> Hi Robin, great meeting you the other day!
>
> As a next step, I'd love to have you meet with our team for a Slack interview. Since we're all remote and spread across the world in different time zones, we've found that three days in a Slack channel with our team works well to get to know each other.
>
> We don't expect you to be responsive at all times during of the Slack interview! Async communication is a big part of how we operate here. The team will ask questions to get to know you, your working style, your interests, your technical skill, and you can ask anyone on our team anything you'd like to learn more about.
>
> Day one will focus on getting to know each other, day two  will focus on more technical questions, and for day three we'll schedule some light pairing (about an hour) with you to see and talk about an interesting problem we're working through in order to gain insight into your approach to technical problem solving.
>
> If that sounds good, how does Tuesday through Thursday work for you?

## Behind the scenes

Our process internally looks like this:

Create two private slack channels: `#platform-robin` and `#backchannel-robin`. The day before the team interview is scheduled to start, invite the team to `#backchannel-robin` and share the Robin's resumÃ©, LinkedIn, or whatever they've provided, and add some context about what stood out about this person, why they might be a great addition to our team, and what topics we should explore further with them. This channel is for coordinating questions, behind the scenes scheduling, and generally discussing Robin's technical abilities, curiosity, etc. On the agreed upon interview start date, invite Robin to your Slack as a single channel guest with an auto-expiring account date. I advise against multi-channel guest because single-channel is free and will save you the embarrassment of inviting them to a channel they shouldn't have seen ðŸ™ˆ.

## Set expectations

Once you've sent the Slack invite, follow up with an email (in case their spam filter gobbled it up) with a note to ping you on Slack when they join. When they're in, reiterate the format and set expectations. We've found it's helpful to be repetitive about this and reinforce the psychological safety of not needing to be talking with us at all hours or feeling anxiety of immediately responding to a question.

> @Robin, welcome to our Slack! I'll be inviting the rest of the team here to get to know you and field any questions you have about us, our culture, how we work, etc. The format is mostly asynchronous, which is a close approximation to our team's working style. We respect that you have pre-existing commitments and we don't expect you to be immediately responsive with us over the next three days. We have team members in at least four different time zones around the world so there will almost always be someone around for you to chat with but if you'd like to let us know sometimes you'll be available to talk in Slack in real-time, we will gladly work around your schedule. If you're unsure, err on the side of over-communication. We won't fault anyone for communicating too much!
>
> To recap the interview schedule and format:
>
> Day one we focus on getting to know each other and ease into the conversation. It can feel a little awkward on both sides as we're mostly strangers trying to get to know each other. We'll lean into the awkwardness and hope you will too! Day two we focus on technical knowledge and experience. You don't need to prepare anything for day two, but we'll ask questions and discuss technical topics with you to get a feel for your understanding, depth, and breadth. Day three we'll schedule some light pairing/debugging (30-60 minutes) with you to see and talk about something our team is working on. Let us know if a particular time works best for you, and we'll do our best to adapt to your schedule.

Invite your team to `#platform-robin` and, if they are new to this approach, remind them (in the backchannel) to give Robin a warm welcome. Let the conversation flow naturally, and consider keeping a suggestion list of topics and questions handy in case things need a nudge.

## Check in periodically

Check in with Robin near the end of the first day:

> Hey Robin, thanks for taking your time to chat with us. Let me know at any point if there's anything you need from me or if you think of any questions about the job you aren't comfortable asking in the channel.

Sometimes there are questions a candidate doesn't want to ask in front of the whole team. Make it safe for them by being explicit about reaching out to you directly if needed.

Send Robin a DM at the beginning of the final interview day, confirm availability and schedule a time slot for pairing if you haven't already. Remind them it's the last day of the interview and that their account will auto-expire that night. Remind your team in `#backchannel-robin` that their Slack account will auto-close at the end of the day and coordinate pairing schedules as needed.

## Post-interview

The day after the Slack interview closes, ping the team in `#backchannel-robin`. We'll either start the discussion in Slack or go for a video call right away. Everyone who was part of the team interview is expected to have an opinion. Hire? No hire? Strong hire? Strong no hire? The team's interactions with Robin will largely drive the opinions. In addition to those, we'll guide conversation with some helpful questions:

* Will the candidate be a culture add?
* Is this someone I'd enjoy working with every day?
* Do they jive with what's important to our team and company?
* Do they bring a new perspective?
* Would it be painful for us _not to hire_ this individual?

## Optimizing for the current team

If anyone on the team has a "no hire" position, we'll upgrade the bandwidth to video chat and dig into those concerns as a team. Sometimes there's a simple misunderstanding or missing context and talking through it with the team can help tease out the underlying issue. Sometimes we'll need to follow-up with the candidate for some clarifying questions. If we can't alleviate the concerns by discussing with the team, or with a follow-up, we'll pass on the candidate. We'll also pass on a candidate immediately if anyone has a "strong no hire" reaction. Because we explicitly prioritize emotional intelligence as a hiring factor (no brilliant jerks), we feel pretty comfortable that we're not introducing a potential bias against "people not like me," but there is indeed a risk here because we are human.

We want to be thorough about uncovering any issues and unconscious biases in our hiring process and also preserve what makes our team unique. I'd rather pass on a potentially great candidate, with only one team member having a "strong no hire" position, than take the risk of ruining goodwill with that team member for hiring someone against their judgment.

## Things we've learned

Be clear with candidates about expectations. Communicate what will happen in this Slack interview to make it smoother for everyone. This approach to interviewing is somewhat unusual, so reduce confusion and ambiguity as much as possible.

Communicate early and often with the candidate. Most people wonâ€™t wait around for your team to get it's shit together. If you arenâ€™t sure if this approach works for you, try it out internally first with a test run.

Be explicit that the pairing sessions are unpaid. We had one bad experience where a candidate we passed on felt they were entitled to compensation for talking through a technical problem with us in an interview format. We agreed to pay in this case and learn from our mistake. The amount was trivial and allowed everyone to walk away from that potentially toxic situation in a somewhat agreeable way.

Don't be afraid to end the interview early if it isn't going well. We've had cases where the team raised concerns in the backchannel, explored with clarifying questions for the candidate, and still felt that there were significant red flags. We'll always get several opinions on this to check our biases, but if we're not feeling good about working with a candidate early on, we will thank them for their time, explain that we don't think there is currently a good fit, and close down the Slack interview. Doing this earlier than later respects the time of the candidate and your team. Drawing out the three day interview for a candidate you aren't thrilled with, while thinking you're being nice, isn't actually helping anyone.

Build in flexibility for very remote time zones. Weâ€™ve found that when talking with candidates in Asia or Australia, we need to be flexible about timing and be upfront with them about this. Because the majority of our team is in North America, the small overlap of working hours that we have with candidates in those time zones can feel like weâ€™ve barely scratched the surface with them. In those time zones where we donâ€™t have a lot of overlap, weâ€™ll go with four days instead of three, so we can make sure weâ€™re getting enough cross over time.

This interview style is time consuming. It requires buy in from your team and management but the benefits are significant. Getting your team acquainted with the candidates in a medium like Slack, where both sides are likely to already feel comfortable, helps put everyone at ease and lets conversation flow more naturally.

Don't run any more than two simultaneous team interviews. The context switching will drive you mad and all work outside the interviews will come to a halt.

Be aware of power dynamics. Be welcoming. Be empathetic toward the candidate's perspective that this might feel like running an AMA for a bunch of strangers on the internet while their job is on the line. Do what you can to make it feel comfortable and safe.

## Your mileage may vary

To run team interviews this way it helps immensely to have a team you trust and a psychologically safe culture where folks are empowered to speak openly. We don't need to have a team debriefing before each interview where we say, "Talk about this thing we did amazingly well, but don't talk about _that thing we really messed up_ because it will make us look bad." Being honest about our strengths and weaknesses helps reinforce a blameless, or blame-aware, culture and builds a foundation of trust with the candidate, which is something often lacking given the power dynamics of the hiring process.

What started as a curious hiring experiment has become core to our team's interview process. So far it seems to be working well and, despite a few fumbles, we've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from candidates about the process. If you have ideas for improvement or want to share your iterations on the process, get in touch.
